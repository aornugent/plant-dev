# Implementation notes

What was built, at what commit, against which build, and what each number moved. The plan
([`build-plan.md`](build-plan.md)) and the prerequisite list
([`tf24-correctness.md`](tf24-correctness.md)) say what to do and carry a commit tag per item; this
file is where a landed change's evidence lives. A claim enters either of those documents only as a
pointer to an entry here or to a commit, so no number is restated in two places.

Numerical changes are recorded as they land and re-blessed together at the end of the phase, so a
failing baseline assertion is expected between here and there and is not a defect.

## The build, pinned

Every gate in this phase is taken at one build, and a value gate that does not name its flags
measures the compiler: the same tree at `-O0` takes 5 095 accepted steps and reports offspring
`4.220134475942768e+01` against `-O2`'s 5 055 and `4.214017357509567e+01` — 0.79% and 0.145% apart,
from the adaptive controller amplifying last-bit differences in arithmetic association.

```sh
rm -f src/*.o src/*.so
R_MAKEVARS_USER=/home/user/p0/Makevars-O2 Rscript -e 'pkgbuild::compile_dll(".", debug = FALSE)'
```

with `/home/user/p0/Makevars-O2` holding `CXX20FLAGS = -O2 -DNDEBUG -g0`.

Three things about this that cost time to establish:

- **`debug = FALSE` is required.** `pkgbuild::compile_dll()` appends `-UNDEBUG -g -O0` *after* any
  user flags, so the last `-O` wins and a Makevars asking for `-O2` is silently overridden.
- **R's make does not track header dependencies.** The strategy and environment core is
  header-inline, so an edit under `inst/include/plant/` changes no `.cpp` timestamp and will not be
  compiled in. Deleting the objects first is not hygiene, it is correctness.
- **A full build is about 95 s** on four cores, which is what makes per-task worktrees affordable.
  The 25 minutes an earlier note records is not this machine.

Absolute times belong to the machine and only same-session ratios transfer: the same tree at `-O2`
has run a production lifetime in 89.9 s, 102.9 s and 86.1 s, every one reproducing the same
offspring value and the same step count.

## The reference forward run

```r
library(odelia); pkgload::load_all(<tree>)
p0 <- scm_base_parameters("TF24", "TF24_Env")
p0$max_patch_lifetime <- 105.32           # on the base parameters, before add_strategies
p <- add_strategies(p0, trait_matrix(0.1978791, "lma"))
scm <- run_scm(p, Environment("TF24"), Control(), collect = FALSE, refine_schedule = FALSE)
```

One species, five soil layers, the default driver. develop `141dc8df` gives offspring
`42.14017357509567` at 5 055 accepted steps. `max_patch_lifetime` is set before `add_strategies`
because that call builds the node schedule.

## Where the work lands

Phase 0 is branched from plant **`origin/develop` (`141dc8df`)**, which is the baseline the plan is
written against, and not from the submodule's checked-out `26c49c76`. That commit is the earlier AD
branch — 108 files and +7 273/−5 042 against develop — and the plan treats it as reference to be
taken from selectively rather than as a base: none of the names it contributes exists at the
baseline, so all of the engine work is new code written against a design. `26c49c76` remains on the
fork as `claude/odelia-ad-tape-reverse-496fuf`, so nothing is lost by moving the superproject's
pointer onto a develop-based branch.

One worktree per task, each built independently, so a task's before-and-after numbers are taken in
one session on one tree:

| branch | items |
|---|---|
| `p0/leaf-purity` | P0.1, P0.2 |
| `p0/soil-vectors` | P0.3, P0.4 |
| `p0/leaf-permutation` | P0.10's probe |
| `p0/switch-inventory` | P0.5's probes |
| `p0/canopy-shape` | P0.7, P0.12 |
| `p0/boundary-reduction` | P0.8 |
| `p0/introduction-rates` | P0.9 |
| `p0/boundary-establishment` | P0.11 |

## Decisions taken during implementation

Recorded here because each closes a choice the plan left open, and the plan's own text is not
edited to track them.

- **P0.12 adopts `CanopyShape`** rather than keeping `pow` with a `u <= 0` guard alone. The
  bit-identical route was the alternative; the shift is accepted and re-blessed with the rest.
- **P0.4 sizes by an explicit `n_resources()`** on `Environment` rather than by shrinking the
  vector at the call site, so the count has one source of truth.
