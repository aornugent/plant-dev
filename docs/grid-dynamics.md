# The grid's cost and error: a debugging record

Which interactions of the system, the solver and the controller block a
predictable error, cost efficiency or inflate runtime, debugged from the runs
on disk with a few cheap probes. Long drought, seed 31, 108 uniform nodes,
Cash–Karp at `3e-5`, unless stated.

Each symptom below is reproduced first, then traced to the component that
produces it. A root cause is claimed only where a test of one variable confirmed
it. Refuted hypotheses are kept.

The scripts:
- `harness/step_program.R` reads saved SCM runs.
- `harness/ark_prototype.R` is the R driver that reproduces the SCM's Cash–Karp
  bit for bit, on v12 (`lib_v12t`). Its new options are `ATTEMPT_LOG`,
  `KNOT_SEED`, `TOL_SOIL` and `ATOL`.
- `harness/attempts.R` reads the driver's attempt logs.
- `harness/replay_timing.R` times the invader's replays on `PLANT-98`.
- The driver's outputs and logs are in `docs/measurements/grid-dynamics/`.

## The symptoms

| | symptom | root cause | state |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | steps: 17 683 on long drought, 3637 on the constant record | the soil's accuracy at the norm's tolerance through each rain-rate change | established; no cheap lever |
| 2 | 17.5–21% of attempts rejected | near knots, the controller probing the soil's new time scale; far from them, the members' sign changes and near-empty pools | established; the probing is cheaper than a seed |
| 3 | the invader's first replay costs about two forwards | `run_mutant` re-runs the resident to keep its field | established |
| 4 | `J`'s time error does not follow the tolerance under plant's default absolute tolerance | near-empty pools, and steps across members' sign changes | established earlier; the pools fixed by the tied tolerance |
| 5 | gradients are a staircase in θ | sign changes sliding past the stages | established earlier |
| 6 | the invader's node error changes sign under halving on uniform nodes | two opposite errors at the layer's top that shrink at different rates | established; the field part's mechanism is under test |
| 7 | the constant record rejects 19% with no knots | — | open |

## 1. The steps

**Reproduced** (`step_program.R`):
- *Rain days hold 44% of the steps,* 5.6 each, rising with depth: 2.9, 4.0,
  5.9 and 9.6 steps by depth quartile.
- *Dry intervals hold the rest,* about 3.5 + 2.8 ln(length in days) each
  (R² 0.42).
- *The constant record takes 3637 steps,* against 9133 to 21 921 on the
  pulsed records.
- *Nodes barely move it:* 17 338 to 18 807 steps from 54 to 429 nodes.
- *The tolerance moves it weakly:* steps go as tol^−0.15.

**Traced** (the driver's ladder, `ck_u108_*` logs):
- *The soil binds 84–91% of accepted steps* at every tolerance from `1e-2` to
  `1e-7`.
- *At `3e-5` those steps are accuracy-limited:* 8.4% of steps start within 0.8
  of the soil's explicit stability limit (1.5% under the tied tolerance),
  against 37% at `1e-2`.

**Hypothesis: the soil's accuracy is more than `J` needs.** The soil binds the
steps, and the stepper scope found its stages carry little of `J`'s time error.

**Test: the soil's tolerance weights ×10, alone.** Under the tied tolerance
(`ATOL=1e-4`). J* = 12.6687135, Cash–Karp at `1e-8`:

| tol | soil weight | accepted | member evaluations | `J − J*`, relative |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `3e-5` | 1 | 17 684 | 7.06e6 | −1.26e-5 |
| `3e-5` | 10 | 13 937 | 5.70e6 | −2.39e-5 |
| `1e-5` | 1 | 21 106 | 8.42e6 | +0.52e-5 |
| `1e-5` | 10 | 16 385 | 6.69e6 | −1.23e-5 |

- *Refuted.* The looser soil adds 1–2e-5 to `J`'s error, as much as the error
  it had. At a matched error it saves about 5%: ×10 at `1e-5` against ×1 at
  `3e-5`.
- *The earlier reading came from plant's default absolute tolerance.* There the
  pools' uncontrolled error swamped the soil's, and one run's `J` is a draw of
  ±2e-4. Under that tolerance the same ×10 seemed free (`ck_u108_*_soil10` logs).
- *The driver's tied run matches today's SCM run:* 17 684 accepted steps against
  17 683.

**Root cause.** The steps are what the soil's accuracy costs through each
rain-rate change, and that accuracy reaches `J` in proportion. So the record
predicts the cost, but no weight on the soil buys accuracy cheaply. What
remains is the method's efficiency on the soil, or the tolerance itself: `J`'s
time error at `1e-4` is 3.7e-5, under 2e-3 of its ε.

## 2. The rejections

**Reproduced.** The SCM rejects 18–21% of attempts on every record and at every
node count (`step_program.R`); the driver rejects 17.5% (`attempts.R`).

**Traced** (one attempt log, `attempts.R` on `ck_u108_3e-5_v12t`):
- *Near knots, the soil rejects.* 85% of rejections start on a knot (40%) or
  within the day after one (45%), and the soil rejects 94% of these.
- *Between 1 and 10 days after a knot there are 32.*
- *In dry spells longer than 10 days, members and storage reject.* Members
  reject 266 there, storage 115 and the soil 2, at a rate of 25–27%.
- *By the change, first attempts at a knot are rejected* at 0.51 where rain
  starts, 0.51 where it falls, 0.39 where it rises and 0.07 where it stops.
- *A rejected first attempt at a knot is usually the whole day to the next
  knot* (median 1.0 day). The step accepted from there has a median of 0.31
  days.

**Hypothesis: the carried proposal.** At a rain-rate change, the controller's
first attempt is sized for the rain before it.

**Test: cap that attempt at the size last accepted after a knot of the same
kind** (`KNOT_SEED=1`), alone:
- *Rejections on knots fall from 1185 to 2.*
- *But accepted steps within a day of a knot rise from 7763 to 10 077,* and
  member evaluations by 7.9%.
- *`J` moves 3.8e-5,* within one run's draw at this tolerance.

**Root cause.** The mechanism holds, but it is not the inefficiency. The
rejected attempt is the controller's probe of the soil's new time scale, and a
cheap one: its estimate shrinks the step straight to the size the soil
accepts. A seed from the last knot of the same kind is too small, so the steps
must grow back. The cost is in the accepted steps (symptom 1). The far
rejections are where the time error's sources sit (symptom 4).

## 3. The invader's replay

**Reproduced.** On the uniform runs the invader phase takes 1.7–1.8× the stand's
forward (`step_program.R`).

**Traced.** `SCM::run_mutant`'s first call re-runs the resident with its field
kept, to record it (`scm.h`, `run_mutant`). It does so even when the stand was
just run with its trajectory recorded.

**Test** (`replay_timing.R`, uniform 108, tied tolerance at `3e-5`):
- the forward takes 114.8 s;
- the first replay 203.5 s;
- the second 91.0 s;
- the invader's `J` is identical in all three.

**Root cause, confirmed.** The first replay holds a second resident forward. It
is about 12% of a run with every gradient of both roles, and paid once per
resident, so it is small across a landscape of invaders.

## 4–7, established earlier or open

- *`J`'s time error* (`docs/archive/scope-imex-stepper.md` §7; the spec's step
  2(a)).
  - Near-empty pools refilling after a sign change carried a survival error as
    large as the offspring part, because their tolerance weight is absolute in
    kg. The tied tolerance fixes that: `J` within 0.46·tol from `1e-3` to
    `3e-5`.
  - The steps across members' sign changes remain. Cash–Karp's estimate
    under-reports them 4.6× (median), and every treatment tried costs 3–4×:
    refusal, split, and locate-and-step.
- *The staircase* (the spec's step 5). The kinks bind curvatures (a chord over
  ±1e-2) and small differences (0.004–0.007 in the invader's `lma` elasticity
  at ±1e-6).
- *The step program's path dependence.* A one-ulp change in the absolute
  tolerance (`3e-9` against `1e-4 × 3e-5`) moves `J` by 4.7e-7 at `3e-5`.
- *The node error* (`docs/measurements/creation-grid.md`, *What sets the node
  error on long drought*). Whether a canopy that cannot comb removes the field
  part is under test.
- *The constant record's rejections.* No attempt log exists there; the next
  probe is one.

## What the record supports, and what it does not

- *Supported: the record predicts the cost.* Steps per rain day follow its depth,
  dry intervals their length, and nodes and tolerance move it little.
- *Not supported: a cheap accuracy lever in the forcing.* The soil's accuracy
  reaches `J` in proportion, and a naive seed from the record costs more than
  the controller's own probing.
- *Supported: the error's sources are the members' and the stand's, located by
  a run.* They are the sign changes, the near-empty pools, the layer's top and
  the fronts.
- *One runtime defect is plain:* the invader's first replay repeats the
  resident's forward.

## Next probes, each one variable

- an attempt log on the constant record, for symptom 7;
- the gradients under the looser soil weight, by the driver's frozen-grid
  differences (`PROGRAM` with `THETA`), since the test above is `J` only;
- the introductions moved by a quarter spacing, R2's other knob, on uniform 108
  and graded G1.
