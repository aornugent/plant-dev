# Developer Guide for Agents (plant-dev Workspace)

This repository (`aornugent/plant-dev`) is a meta-repository (superproject) used to manage local development across the `traitecoevo` family of R packages: `logpile`, `plant`, and `odelia`.

## Workspace Structure
- `logpile/`: Submodule pointing to `https://github.com/aornugent/logpile.git`
- `plant/`: Submodule pointing to `https://github.com/aornugent/plant.git`
- `odelia/`: Submodule pointing to `https://github.com/aornugent/odelia.git`

Each submodule also has an `upstream` remote configured pointing to the official `traitecoevo` repository.

## CRITICAL: Write Permissions
**Agents do NOT have push access to the `traitecoevo` organization repositories.** 

You must never attempt to push directly to `traitecoevo/*` remotes.

## Workflow for Agents
1. **Branching**: When starting work on a feature or bugfix, navigate into the relevant submodule directory (e.g., `cd plant`) and create a new branch.
2. **Committing**: Make your changes and commit them normally within the submodule.
3. **Pushing Changes**: Push your branches to the `origin` remote, which points to the `aornugent` fork (e.g., `git push origin my-feature`).
4. **Updating the Meta-Repo**: After pushing commits in a submodule, navigate back to the root of `plant-dev`. You will see that the submodule pointer has changed in `git status`. Add and commit this hash update in `plant-dev`, and push it to `origin` (`aornugent/plant-dev`).
5. **Propagating Upstream**: To get changes into the official `traitecoevo` repositories, you must instruct the user to create a Pull Request on GitHub from the `aornugent` fork to the `traitecoevo` upstream.

## Upstream Synchronization
To sync a submodule with the official repository, fetch and merge from the `upstream` remote, then push to the `origin` fork:
```bash
cd <submodule>
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master # (or main)
git push origin master
```
