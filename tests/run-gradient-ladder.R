#
# WHAT THESE CHECKS ARE, AND WHY THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM
#
# The claim under test is that the reverse sweep is the exact transpose of the
# forward run. That claim cannot be checked by a finite difference, because
# differencing is the thing the sweep replaces -- and near a coincidence a
# difference does not merely lose accuracy, it fails to converge. So the claim is
# checked against references that share no code with the sweep, and the files
# below are grouped by which reference each one uses.
#
# There are four references, and none of them alone is enough:
#
#   1. A FORWARD-MODE TANGENT of the same forward source. Exact -- no step size,
#      no truncation -- and it traverses the forward reductions while touching
#      none of the transposes under test. One seed gives one exact column.
#      ⚠️ It cannot see a wrong SUPPLIED row: the tangent runs the same supplied
#      numbers through the same attachment, so a bad row makes both routes wrong
#      identically. That is what reference 4 is for.
#
#   2. THE WHOLE JACOBIAN, formed entry by entry, at one cohort. A contraction
#      against a seed returns one number, hides an error behind a small seed
#      component, and localises to nothing when it fails. Affordable only at the
#      smallest fixture, which is why that fixture exists.
#
#   3. A DIFFERENCE OF WHOLE RUNS in plain double. The only reference that shares
#      no arithmetic at all with the sweep, and therefore the only one that can
#      catch a common-mode error. Coarse, so it bounds rather than pins.
#
#   4. THE FORWARD MODEL REBUILT FROM ITS PARAMETERS, which is the one place
#      references 1 and 2 are blind together. A rebuild runs preparation, so the
#      leaf is CONSTRUCTED with the moved trait rather than handed it afterwards,
#      and differencing the rates then traverses the leaf's forward solve while
#      touching none of the derivative code the supplied rows come from.
#      ⚠️ It is needed because differencing the recorded step cannot referee a
#      supplied row at all: the recorded expression is the value plus a sum of
#      partials times brackets that are each exactly zero, so the difference comes
#      back EXACTLY zero on precisely the columns a supplied row occupies --
#      whether the row is right, wrong, or absent.
#
# The fixtures form a progression -- the "ladder" the filenames name -- from the
# smallest stand whose Jacobian can be formed whole, through accumulation across
# cohorts and species, to a stand whose state vector changes width. Each step
# adds one mechanism and uses the strongest reference its size still permits.
#
# ⚠️ A MARGIN IS NOT A PASS. Every check reports how much of its tolerance budget
# it used, because a check passing at three-quarters of budget is a check about to
# stop working. And a suite of margins says nothing about whether the checks would
# notice a defect at all, which is what the fault injections establish: two of the
# first three injections tried here failed to fail.
#
# ⚠️ A SKIP IS NOT A PASS EITHER. A skip is these checks naming something they
# cannot yet ask. Read the skip count beside the failures every time.
